To generate a role
ansible-galaxy init <role name>

As noted in Creating Reusable Playbooks, include and import statements are very similar, however the Ansible executor engine treats them very differently.
• All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
• All include* statements are processed as they are encountered during the execution of the playbook.
